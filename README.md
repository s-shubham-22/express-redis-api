# Express.js API with Redis Caching

This is an example project demonstrating how to use Redis caching with an Express.js API.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-redis-caching.git
cd express-redis-caching
npm install
```

To start the application, run `npm start`.

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The API provides a `/posts` endpoint that retrieves post data from a mock database. The response data is cached in Redis to improve performance.

To retrieve user data, send a GET request to the `/posts` endpoint.

```bash
GET /posts
```

```bash
GET /posts/:id
```
